This is a very basic weather app for a specific location:

Latitude: 56.1518
Longitude: 10.2064
Address: Rosenkrantzgade 19B, 8000 Aarhus C

Could be extended to more location by adjusting the WeatherHandler, allowing the dev to input coordinates.

## To start

Start by installing dependencies with `npm install`, then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
